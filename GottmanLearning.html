    <!-- Slide 1: Foundations of the Gottman Method -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h1>The Gottman Method: Expert Training Guide</h1>
      <p>
        The Gottman Method, developed by Drs. John and Julie Gottman, leverages over 40 years of longitudinal research on thousands of couples to create a structured approach to therapy. It’s rooted in the Sound Relationship House (SRH) theory, predicting marital stability with 91% accuracy (*J. Family Psychology*, 1998). This deck dives deep into SRH’s seven levels, advanced conflict tools, repair strategies, and emotional attunement—equipping you for expertise.

    <!-- Slide 2: Research and Core Concepts -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Research Foundations and Core Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        The Gottmans’ “Love Lab” observed couples’ physiology (heart rate, stress hormones) and interactions, identifying predictors of divorce (e.g., Four Horsemen) and stability (e.g., 5:1 ratio). Key concepts include bid dynamics, emotional flooding, and perpetual vs. solvable issues—69% of conflicts are perpetual (*J. Marriage & Family*, 2000).
      </p>
      <h3>Key Studies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1998: 5:1 positive-to-negative ratio predicts stability.</li>
        <li>2001: 20:1 bid response ratio in thriving couples.</li>
        <li>2013: Gottman interventions cut divorce risk by 50% (*Psychological Science*).</li>
      </ul>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What did the Love Lab measure?" answer="Couples’ physiology (e.g., heart rate) and interactions" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What percentage of conflicts are perpetual?" answer="69%" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the divorce risk reduction from Gottman interventions?" answer="50%" />

    <!-- Slide 3: Level 1 - Build Love Maps -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Level 1: Build Love Maps</h2>
      <p>
        Love Maps detail a partner’s psychological world—dreams, stressors, history. A 1999 study found 70% of happy couples maintained robust Love Maps (*The Seven Principles*). Weak maps signal disconnection, especially under stress. Advanced: Map emotional triggers (e.g., past traumas).
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Over 7 days, ask one daily open-ended question (e.g., “What’s a childhood memory that shaped you?”). Record answers to build a Love Map journal.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What constitutes a Love Map?" answer="A detailed mental map of a partner’s dreams, stressors, and history" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What percentage of happy couples have strong Love Maps?" answer="70%" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s an advanced Love Map focus?" answer="Mapping emotional triggers like past traumas" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a 7-day Love Map exercise?" answer="Ask one open-ended question daily and journal the answers" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 4: Level 2 - Share Fondness and Admiration -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Level 2: Share Fondness and Admiration</h2>
      <p>
        Fondness counters contempt—one of the Four Horsemen. Couples with a 5:1 positive-to-negative ratio during conflict show resilience (*J. Family Psychology*, 1998). Advanced: Use “positive sentiment override” to reinterpret neutral acts as loving.
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Daily, write and share three specific appreciations (e.g., “I admired how you calmed our child today”). Track ratio shifts over a month.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What does fondness counteract?" answer="Contempt" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the 5:1 ratio?" answer="Five positive interactions per negative one during conflict" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s positive sentiment override?" answer="Interpreting neutral acts as loving due to a strong fondness base" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a fondness exercise?" answer="Write and share three specific appreciations daily" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 5: Level 3 - Turn Toward Instead of Away -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Level 3: Turn Toward Instead of Away</h2>
      <p>
        Bids are bids for connection—verbal or non-verbal. Turning toward builds an “emotional bank account”; a 20:1 positive response ratio marks thriving couples (Gottman Institute, 2001). Advanced: Recognize micro-bids (e.g., a sigh) and repair missed turns.
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Log bids for 24 hours—count turns toward, away, or against. Aim for 80% positive responses, then discuss missed bids.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What are bids?" answer="Verbal or non-verbal attempts to connect" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the 20:1 ratio?" answer="20 positive bid responses per negative in thriving couples" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a micro-bid example?" answer="A sigh or subtle glance seeking attention" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a bid-tracking exercise?" answer="Log bids for 24 hours, aiming for 80% positive responses" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 6: Level 4 - The Positive Perspective -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Level 4: The Positive Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        A positive perspective assumes good intent, buffering negativity. The Love Lab found 94% of couples with this stayed together over four years (*J. Marriage & Family*, 2000). Advanced: Master repair attempts—short, positive interventions during tension (e.g., “Let’s take a break”).
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> During your next conflict, use a repair attempt (e.g., humor, apology). Note its effect on de-escalation.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What defines the Positive Perspective?" answer="Assuming good intent to buffer negativity" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the 4-year stability rate for couples with a positive perspective?" answer="94%" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a repair attempt?" answer="A short, positive intervention during tension, like ‘Let’s take a break’" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 7: Level 5 - Manage Conflict (Expanded) -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Level 5: Manage Conflict</h2>
      <p>
        Conflict management splits into solvable (situational) and perpetual (core values) issues—69% are perpetual. The 5:1 ratio applies in disagreements; soft startups (e.g., “I’m upset about…”) reduce escalation. Advanced: Use the “Four Horsemen” antidotes—replace criticism with complaints, contempt with appreciation, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>Four Horsemen and Antidotes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Criticism → Complaint (“You’re lazy” vs. “I need help with chores”)</li>
        <li>Contempt → Appreciation</li>
        <li>Defensiveness → Responsibility</li>
        <li>Stonewalling → Self-soothing</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Identify a recent conflict—label Horsemen present and practice their antidotes in a mock redo.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the antidote to criticism?" answer="A specific complaint, e.g., ‘I need help’ instead of ‘You’re lazy’" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the antidote to stonewalling?" answer="Self-soothing, like taking a break to calm down" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a conflict redo exercise?" answer="Revisit a conflict, identify Horsemen, and apply antidotes" />
        <orbit-prompt question-attachments="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200.png?text=Soft+Startup" question="Is this a soft or harsh startup?" answer="Soft—it uses ‘I feel…’" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 8: Level 6 - Make Life Dreams Come True -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Level 6: Make Life Dreams Come True</h2>
      <p>
        Supporting dreams prevents gridlock—unresolved perpetual conflicts. Dreams range from career goals to simple joys. Advanced: Use “Dreams Within Conflict” technique—probe underlying needs (e.g., security) behind positions (e.g., “I want a big house”).
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Pick a gridlocked issue. Ask: “What’s the dream behind your stance?” Plan one supportive step.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What causes gridlock?" answer="Unmet dreams in perpetual conflicts" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the ‘Dreams Within Conflict’ technique?" answer="Probing underlying needs behind conflict positions" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a dream-support exercise?" answer="Ask ‘What’s your dream here?’ and plan a step" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 9: Level 7 - Create Shared Meaning -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Level 7: Create Shared Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        Shared meaning builds a couple’s culture—rituals (e.g., date nights), goals (e.g., family legacy). It boosts satisfaction by 30% (Gottman Institute, 2023). Advanced: Craft a “Relationship Mission Statement” reflecting joint values.
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Draft a mission statement (e.g., “We prioritize adventure and support”). Establish two rituals to reflect it.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What forms shared meaning?" answer="Shared rituals, goals, and values" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the satisfaction boost from shared meaning?" answer="30%" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a shared meaning exercise?" answer="Draft a mission statement and establish two rituals" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 10: Advanced Tools - Repair and De-escalation -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Advanced Tools: Repair and De-escalation</h2>
      <p>
        Repair attempts—humor, apologies—halt negativity. Successful repairs require a strong SRH base (*J. Family Psychology*, 2002). De-escalation involves physiological self-soothing (e.g., 20-min breaks when flooded—pulse >100 bpm).
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Next argument, use a repair (e.g., “I’m sorry, let’s slow down”) and a break if flooded. Reflect on outcomes.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a repair attempt?" answer="A positive action like humor or apology to halt negativity" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the physiological sign of flooding?" answer="Pulse over 100 bpm" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s a de-escalation exercise?" answer="Use a repair and take a 20-min break if flooded" />
      </orbit-reviewarea>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 11: Emotional Attunement and Trust -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Emotional Attunement and Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Trust underpins SRH—betrayal (emotional/physical) erodes it. Attunement (Awareness, Tolerance, Understanding, Non-defensive responding, Empathy) rebuilds it (*Trust & Betrayal*, Gottman, 2011). Advanced: Use the “ATTUNE” model in daily check-ins.
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Practice ATTUNE—15-min daily dialogue: Acknowledge feelings, Tolerate disagreement, Understand needs, Respond non-defensively, Empathize.</p>
      </div>
      <orbit-reviewarea>
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s the ATTUNE model?" answer="Awareness, Tolerance, Understanding, Non-defensive responding, Empathy" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What rebuilds trust?" answer="Emotional attunement via the ATTUNE model" />
        <orbit-prompt question="What’s an attunement exercise?" answer="15-min daily dialogue using ATTUNE steps" />

    <!-- Slide 12: Mastery Path -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Your Path to Gottman Mastery</h2>
      <p>
        Expertise requires practice—apply SRH daily, track ratios (5:1, 20:1), neutralize Horsemen, and attune emotionally. Orbit reinforces this—review prompts weekly. Certified Gottman Therapists train 300+ hours; aim for 50 exercises here first.
      </p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Pick 5 principles. Practice one daily for 10 days each—journal changes in connection and conflict.</p>
